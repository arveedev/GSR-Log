Phase 1: The Blueprint
Before we dive into any code or specific components, we need to create a unified design system. Right now, your styled components might be a bit fragmented. We'll fix that by creating a clear, consistent set of rules. This ensures every button, form, and text block on your site feels like it belongs.

Here's our plan for the first phase:

Audit and Analysis: We'll start by taking a good look at your current app. What's working? What's not? We'll identify the key user flows and pinpoint any areas of friction. We'll also examine the current components and see what we can reuse or improve upon.

User Personas and Journeys: You need to know who you're designing for. We'll create user personasâ€”fictional characters that represent your target audience. This helps us empathize with them and understand their goals and pain points. We'll then map out their user journeys to see how they'll interact with the app, from the first click to their final action.

Mood Board and Visual Language: Let's find the "vibe" of your app. We'll create a mood board to define our visual language, including typography, color palettes, and overall aesthetic. We're aiming for "professional but fun," so we'll need to find a balance between clean lines and creative, maybe even playful, elements.

Phase 2: Design and Prototyping
Once we have the blueprint, we can start designing. We'll move from broad concepts to specific components and screens. This is where we bring your app to life.

Here's our plan for the second phase:

Component Library: We'll create a new, streamlined component library using your styled components. This will include things like buttons, form inputs, cards, and navigation menus. Each component will be designed with consistency and reusability in mind.

Interaction and Animation: This is where we'll add that "slick and animated" feel. We'll plan out subtle, purposeful animations for things like page transitions, button hovers, and data loading. The goal is to make the app feel responsive and alive, not just a static page. We'll use principles like ease-in and ease-out to make the animations feel smooth and natural.

High-Fidelity Mockups and Prototyping: We'll create detailed designs of the key screens, showing exactly how the final product will look. We'll also build a clickable prototype. This lets us test our design with real people and get feedback before we write a single line of new code.

Phase 3: Development and Implementation
This is the final phase, where we take our designs and turn them into a real, working application. We'll be very deliberate and methodical here to ensure everything is perfect.

Styled Components Refactoring: We'll refactor your existing styled components to align with our new design system. This isn't just about changing colors; it's about creating a clean, scalable architecture. We'll use things like theme providers and a consistent naming convention to keep everything organized.

Accessibility First: We'll bake accessibility into the process from the start. We'll make sure the app is usable for everyone, including those with disabilities. We'll check for proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

Performance Optimization: Animations and slick UIs can sometimes slow things down. We'll pay close attention to performance, ensuring our animations are smooth and don't cause any stuttering or lag, especially on mobile devices.

Design Architecture & Prompt
To make sure we're on the same page, we need a clear architecture to follow. Think of this as our single source of truth for all design decisions.

Here is a prompt we can use to guide our work:

Design Architecture & Prompt
"Re-imagine the current web application's UI/UX to be modern, slick, and professional yet fun. The new design system will be built on a modular, component-based architecture using styled components. The goal is to create a delightful and intuitive user experience (UX) with a strong emphasis on clean, legible typography, a vibrant yet balanced color palette, and subtle, meaningful animations. The design must be scalable and fully responsive, prioritizing mobile-first principles. Key considerations include:

Uniformity: All components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.) must follow a single, cohesive design language. We'll create a style guide that defines typography, color variables, spacing, and component states (e.g., hover, active, disabled).

User-Centricity: The design will prioritize ease of use and clarity. We'll minimize cognitive load by using clear visual hierarchy and intuitive layouts. The user journey should be smooth, with minimal clicks to complete a task.

Animation & Micro-interactions: Animations will be used purposefully to provide feedback, guide the user's attention, and add personality. They should be subtle, quick, and non-intrusive.

Accessibility: The final design must adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, ensuring it's usable by everyone. This includes proper color contrast, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.

Based on this architecture, our first step is to establish the visual language. Please provide a mood board, or at least a few keywords, that capture the desired feel of the app. Once we have that, we can start designing the foundational components."
